    <p>Our story begins in 1975 on the palm-lined boulevard Burton Way, a stone’s throw from Rodeo Drive, the beating heart of
    Beverly Hills. Initially built as residences, we had the vision to develop the property into something more — an
    exclusive 5-star hideaway that felt like home. So, we transformed the collection of private luxury residences into what
    would be an all-suite hotel focused on exceptional service and world-class hospitality.</p>
    <p>Our spacious suites and flawless service ushered in a new era of luxury hospitality and made waves in Beverly Hills. Our
    signature suites were appointed in the most elegant finishes with all the lavish touches a discerning guest might
    desire. We became known for our unparalleled attention to detail and the privacy our large rooms and discreet location
    afforded. L’Ermitage soon became the gold standard for the global elite and celebrity set alike.</p>
